Performance Optimization Layers (Full-Stack DevOps Cheat Sheet)

Layer	Technique	Description	Key Tools/APIs	Impact Area
Frontend	Code Splitting	Load JavaScript in smaller chunks per route/component.	React.lazy, Suspense, dynamic import() (Vite)	Initial Load Time, TTI
Server State Management	Sync, cache, and fetch backend data smartly.	TanStack Query (React Query)	Responsiveness, Network Usage
Memoization	Avoid unnecessary re-renders of React components.	React.memo, useMemo, useCallback	CPU Usage, Responsiveness
Virtualization	Render only visible items in lists/grids.	react-window, react-virtualized	Memory Usage, Responsiveness
Bundle Analysis	Audit your bundle for bloated dependencies.	rollup-plugin-visualizer (via Vite)	Initial Load Time
Build	CSS Purging	Strip unused styles for leaner CSS.	Tailwind JIT	Load Time, Network Usage
Asset Optimization	Compress images, fonts, and other static assets.	Vite asset pipeline, Image optimization tools	Load Time
Backend	Async Operations	Use non-blocking I/O for faster response.	async/await, Promises	Throughput, Responsiveness
Caching	Cache hot data to minimize DB calls.	In-memory, Redis, Memcached	Latency, Database Load
Response Compression	Shrink payloads to reduce bandwidth.	compression middleware (Gzip/Brotli)	Load Time, Network Usage
Concurrency Management	Scale Node processes across CPU cores.	pm2, Node.js cluster	Throughput (CPU-bound tasks)
Efficient Logging	Use non-blocking logging tools.	Pino, Winston	Throughput, Stability
Database	Query Optimization	Write selective queries, inspect execution plans.	EXPLAIN ANALYZE, Drizzle Query Builder	Latency, DB CPU/IO Load
Indexing	Speed up searches on large tables.	CREATE INDEX	Query Latency
Connection Pooling	Reuse DB connections to reduce setup cost. Essential for serverless (e.g., Neon).	PgBouncer, Neon Pooler, Drizzle pooling	Latency, Cold Starts, DB Load
Batch Operations	Combine multiple operations in one trip.	Drizzle batch API	Latency, Network Round Trips
Electron	Minimize Main Process Work	Offload tasks to renderer or utility processes.	Electron process model	Startup Time, Responsiveness
Optimize Preload Scripts	Keep preload scripts light and async.	Preload script best practices	Startup Time
Monitoring	Frontend Profiling	Analyze rendering time and bottlenecks.	React DevTools Profiler, Chrome DevTools	UI Responsiveness
Backend APM/Profiling	Trace backend calls and system resource usage.	APM tools, node --prof, Postman monitoring	Server Bottlenecks
Database Monitoring	Monitor slow queries, connections, and performance stats.	pg_stat_statements, Neon Console	Query Bottlenecks, Connection Stats
